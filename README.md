# 🚗 RentRide – Digital Vehicle Rental Solution

RentRide is a web-based vehicle rental project developed to make the process of booking and managing vehicles easier and more organized. Users can browse available vehicles and book them online, while the admin can manage vehicles and reservations from a dashboard.

## About the Project

This project was built as a full-stack web application to simulate a real-world vehicle rental platform. It focuses on creating a simple and user-friendly system where customers can check availability and make bookings, and administrators can manage the overall system.

## How the System Works

* Users create an account and log in to the platform
* Available vehicles are displayed with their details and pricing
* Users choose rental dates and confirm their booking
* Booking information is stored and updated in the database
* Admin manages vehicles and monitors all reservations

## Technologies Used

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap (Frontend)
* Node.js and Express.js (Backend)
* MongoDB (Database)
* Git and GitHub for version control
